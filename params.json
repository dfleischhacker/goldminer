The build process\r\nis based on Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org). After having installed Maven, change into the Gold Miner source\r\ndirectory and use \"mvn package\" to start the build process. Have a look at the target/ folder which contains the\r\ngold-miner-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar which is the one you would like to use most probably.\r\n\r\n### Remark\r\nIn the following we use\r\n        goldminer.jar\r\nto refer to the name of the Gold Miner JAR. For calling Gold Miner, you have to replace goldminer.jar by the correct\r\nfile name or rename your jar file to goldminer.jar.\r\n\r\n### Configuring Gold Miner\r\nCall gold miner using the genconfig command\r\n    java -jar goldminer.jar genconfig\r\nwhich generates the config files miner.properties and axioms.properties in the current directory.\r\nAdapt miner.properties to your environment and choose the axiom types you want to generate by setting them to true\r\nin axioms.properties. The axioms types not to generate have to be set to false.\r\n\r\n### Running Gold Miner\r\nRunning Gold Miner includes three phases. In the first phase, Gold Miner inspects the ontology for concepts and\r\nproperties, the SPARQL endpoint for instances and generates the transaction tables required for the currently\r\nconfigured axiom types. This phase might take longer depending on the performance of your SPARQL endpoint. You can\r\nstart the generation phase using\r\n    java -jar goldminer.jar generate\r\n\r\nThe next step uses the Borgelt apriori miner to generate association rules and is started by\r\n    java -jar goldminer.jar mine\r\n\r\nIn the final step, the association rules are parsed and the ontology is enriched with the resulting axioms. Use\r\n    java -jar goldminer.jar parse\r\nto start this phase.\r\n\r\n### Re-running Gold Miner\r\nIf you want to re-run Gold Miner completely you either have to empty all directories which contain results from previous\r\nruns or empty the checkpoints/ directory in your transaction_tables directory (as defined in the miner.properties config\r\nfile) since Gold Miner uses this directory to store its progress.\r\n\r\n# Contributors\r\n* Daniel Fleischhacker (email: [daniel@dwslab.de](mailto:daniel@dwslab.de))\r\n* Johanna Völker\r\n* Mathias Niepert\r\n* Jakob Frankenbach\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (C) 2011-2014 Johanna Völker, Mathias Niepert, Daniel Fleischhacker\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
